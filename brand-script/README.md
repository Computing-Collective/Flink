# Brand Script

Integrating with Flink is simple! This is the script for our single line of HTML that goes into the head of e-commerce websites.

## Usage

The following uses the [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com) CDN to serve the Flink script from GitHub (and keep it up to date). To use Flink as a brand, add the following line to the head of your website:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.githack.com/Computing-Collective/Flink/main/brand-script/script.js" defer="defer"></script>
```
